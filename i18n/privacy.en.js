        <p>Lettiq does not use cookies (it is a native mobile app, not a website).</p>
        <p>Ads are served via <strong>Google AdMob</strong> and mediated through <strong>AppLovin MAX</strong>. These services use your device's advertising identifier (IDFA/GAID) to show relevant ads. On iOS, you may be asked for permission to track via Apple's App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework before personalised ads are shown. You can reset your advertising ID or opt out of ad personalisation at any time in your device's privacy settings:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Android</strong> — Settings → Privacy → Ads</li>
          <li><strong>iOS</strong> — Settings → Privacy &amp; Security → Tracking</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You may also opt out of interest-based advertising via <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google's ad settings</a>.</p>
        <p>The app is configured for age-restricted (child-directed) treatment in Google AdMob, which disables behavioural targeting.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>We do not knowingly collect data that requires parental consent beyond a display name and advertising identifier, both of which can be managed or reset by a parent.</li>
          <li>Google AdMob is configured in child-directed mode, which disables behavioural ad targeting.</li>
